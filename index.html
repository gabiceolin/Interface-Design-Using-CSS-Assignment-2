                And everything you do<br>
                Yeah, they were all yellow <br></div>
            <br>
            I came along<br>
            I wrote a song for you<br>
            And all the things you do<br>
            And it was called "Yellow. "<br>
            <br>
            So then I took my turn<br>
            Oh what a thing to've done<br>
            And it was all yellow<br>
            <br>
            Your skin<br>
            Oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
            Turn into something beautiful<br>
            Do you know?<br>
            You know I love you so<br>
            You know I love you so<br>
            <br>
            I swam across<br>
            I jumped across for you<br>
            Oh what a thing to do<br>
            'Cause you were all yellow <br>
            I drew a line<br>
            I drew a line for you<br>
            Oh what a thing to do<br>
            And it was all yellow<br>
            <br>
            Your skin<br>
            Oh yeah your skin and bones<br>
            Turn into something beautiful<br>
            You know<br>
            For you I'd bleed myself dry<br>
            For you I'd bleed myself dry<br>
            <br>
            <div class="chorus">
